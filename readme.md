Ohmyfood! is an online meal ordering company. Our concept allows users to compose their own menu and reduce their waiting time in restaurants because their menu is prepared in advance.

The main goal of this project website is to master Scss and BEM, as well as CSS animations and transitions.

The code had to be made of pure HTML5 and CSS3 without any framework (bootstrap, tailwind…) nor preprocessor (sass).
